        <h2>Contract</h2> 
        <p>I, Christina M. Rivenburg, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SEMESTER 2025, ITSC1110, Computer Science Principles with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.</p>
        
        <p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork or that I wish to keep private.</p>
        
        <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
        
        <p>I also understand that given the structure and content of this class, it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I will only use these resources to learn and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e., external libraries) and never from my classmates.</p>
